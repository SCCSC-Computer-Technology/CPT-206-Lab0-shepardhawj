# New Mark Down File Created
In this cource I learned that Git is a distributed Version Control System and GitHub is a way to use Git online with easy-to-use interface. I also learned about the different terms used in GitHub such as repositories, pushing, pulling, branches, etc. I learned that there is a main branch and you can create many other branches that can be edited and pushed to the main branch. Again, this helps with version control and allowing developers to work on different tasks of a big project. Some things that I am still confused about are the functionalities of pulling and what defines a pull request. I also do not understand how different repositories work within an organization, like can I sabotage someone else's repoository in my organization.
